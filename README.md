### This is the source code for the frontend of the PizzaAPI project for Databases by students Dan Parii and Simon KÃ¶hl. You can visit the front end here: https://simonkoehl01.github.io/pizza4all/menu.html but please be aware that the backend is not up, so you will not be able to test orders, see the menu etc. To test this functionality, please contact one of the repository owners.
